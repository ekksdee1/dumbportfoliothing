        <h1>About me!</h1>
        <h4>Future plans</h4>
        <p>
            I am a senior at Sylvania Northview HS, graduating June 2024. I plan to attend the Ohio State University
            in Columbus, OH, where I will major in Computer Science/Engineering. I want to graduate with a four-year
            Computer Science degree, and then land a job as a software engineer. While I am in college, I will be looking
            for internship opportunities. I have had a deep interest in computers since I was a child, and I started 
            programming in 2022, my junior year of high school. I have studied various programming languages, including
            HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, and C++. I have participated in Business Professionals of America's State Leadership
            Conference twice for web design, in which I made a website from scratch based off an example, given an extremely 
            limited amount of time.

        <h4>Other interests</h4>
        <p>
            Besides all things technology, I enjoy playing video games and playing my violin. I participated in the Ohio
            Music Education Association's Solo & Ensemble competition for three years. In total, I played in two ensembles and
            played three solos. I also regularly participate in a community orchestra called the Greater Toledo International
            Youth Orchestra, which I joined in 2019. Additionally, I conducted undergraduate-level solar cell research at the University of Toledo's 
            Wright Center for Photovoltaic Innovation and Commercialization for my year-long AP Research project. I presented 
            this project at the Buckeye Science and Engineering Fair, as well as the Ohio State District Science Day competition.
