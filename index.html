            <h4>My interests</h4>
            <p>
                I have had a deep interest in computers since I was a child. I would always take apart and put computers back together,
                until eventually I learned how to assemble a computer. Even the desktop I use now I personally built. I started programming 
                in 2022, my junior year of high school. I have studied various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, 
                and C++. I participated in Business Professionals of America's State Leadership Conference twice for web design my junior
                and senior year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides all things technology, I enjoy playing video games and playing my violin. I participated in the Ohio
                Music Education Association's Solo & Ensemble competition for three years. In total, I played in two ensembles and
                played three solos. I also regularly participate in a community orchestra called the Greater Toledo International
                Youth Orchestra, which I joined in 2019. Additionally, I conducted undergraduate-level solar cell research at the University of Toledo's 
                Wright Center for Photovoltaic Innovation and Commercialization for my year-long AP Research project. I presented 
                this project at the Buckeye Science and Engineering Fair, as well as the Ohio State District Science Day competition.

            <h4>Future plans</h4>
            <p>
                I am a senior at Sylvania Northview HS, graduating June 2024. I plan to attend the Ohio State University
                in Columbus, OH, where I will major in Computer Science/Engineering. I want to graduate with a four-year
                Computer Science degree, and then land a job as a software engineer. While I am in college, I will be looking
                for internship opportunities.
